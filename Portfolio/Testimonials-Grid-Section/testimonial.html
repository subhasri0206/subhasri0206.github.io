                    up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <p class="testimonial-text text-white">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                    code. I needed
                    some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                    to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                    entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                    for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                    next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                    interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
